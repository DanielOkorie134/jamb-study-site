ELASTIC COLLISION:\n- Both momentum and kinetic energy conserved\n- Objects bounce off each other\n- No energy lost to heat/sound\n- Example: billiard balls\n\n2. INELASTIC COLLISION:\n- Momentum conserved\n- Kinetic energy NOT conserved (some lost)\n- Objects may stick together\n- Example: car crash\n\nIMPULSE:\n- Change in momentum\n- Impulse = Force × Time\n- Also: Impulse = Change in momentum = m(v - u)\n- Unit: N·s\n\nAPPLICATIONS:\n- Airbags (increase time, reduce force)\n- Following through in sports\n- Rocket propulsion\n- Recoil of guns",
