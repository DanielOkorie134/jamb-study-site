    "detailedNotes": "Newton's Laws explain how objects move when forces act on them.\n\nFIRST LAW (Law of Inertia):\nAn object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity, unless acted upon by a net external force.\n- Inertia: resistance to change in motion\n- Depends on mass (more mass = more inertia)\n\nSECOND LAW (F = ma):\nThe acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to its mass.\n- F = ma (Force = mass × acceleration)\n- Unit of force: Newton (N) = kg·m/s²\n- Direction of acceleration is in direction of net force\n\nTHIRD LAW (Action-Reaction):\nFor every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n- Forces always occur in pairs\n- Act on different objects\n- Equal in magnitude, opposite in direction\n\nAPPLICATIONS:\n- Rocket propulsion (gases pushed down, rocket pushed up)\n- Walking (foot pushes ground back, ground pushes foot forward)\n- Swimming (hands push water back, water pushes swimmer forward)\n\nFORCE TYPES:\n- Weight: W = mg (force due to gravity)\n- Normal force: perpendicular support force\n- Friction: opposes motion\n- Tension: force in strings/ropes",

        "solution": "According to Newton's Third Law, the wall exerts an equal and opposite force on the person.\nForce = 100 N (in the opposite direction)\n\nThe wall pushes back with 100 N, preventing the person from moving forward."
