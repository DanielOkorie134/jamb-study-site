    "detailedNotes": "Work, energy, and power are interconnected concepts in physics.\n\nWORK:\n- Work = Force × Distance (in direction of force)\n- W = F × d × cosθ (θ = angle between force and displacement)\n- Unit: Joule (J) = N·m\n- Work is done only when force causes displacement\n\nENERGY:\nCapacity to do work. Types:\n\n1. Kinetic Energy (KE):\n- Energy of motion\n- KE = ½mv²\n- Depends on mass and velocity\n\n2. Potential Energy (PE):\n- Stored energy due to position\n- Gravitational PE = mgh\n- Elastic PE = ½kx² (for springs)\n\n3. Mechanical Energy:\n- ME = KE + PE\n- Conserved in absence of friction\n\nCONSERVATION OF ENERGY:\n- Energy cannot be created or destroyed\n- Only transformed from one form to another\n- Total energy remains constant\n\nPOWER:\n- Rate of doing work or transferring energy\n- P = Work/Time = W/t\n- P = Energy/Time = E/t\n- Unit: Watt (W) = J/s\n- Also: P = Fv (force × velocity)\n\nEFFICIENCY:\n- Efficiency = (Useful energy output / Total energy input) × 100%\n- Always less than 100% (due to energy losses)",
