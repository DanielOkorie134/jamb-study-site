      "detailedNotes": "**Key Concepts:**\n\n**1. Distance vs Displacement**\n- **Distance**: Total path length traveled (scalar)\n- **Displacement**: Straight-line distance from start to finish with direction (vector)\n\nExample: Walking 3m east, then 4m north\n- Distance = 7m\n- Displacement = 5m (using Pythagoras)\n\n**2. Speed vs Velocity**\n- **Speed**: Distance/Time (scalar, no direction)\n  - Formula: v = d/t\n  - Unit: m/s, km/h\n- **Velocity**: Displacement/Time (vector, has direction)\n  - Formula: v = s/t\n  - Unit: m/s\n\n**3. Types of Speed**\n- **Uniform/Constant Speed**: Same speed throughout\n- **Variable Speed**: Speed changes\n- **Average Speed**: Total distance / Total time\n- **Instantaneous Speed**: Speed at a particular moment\n\n**4. Acceleration**\n- Rate of change of velocity\n- Formula: a = (v-u)/t\n  - a = acceleration (m/s²)\n  - v = final velocity (m/s)\n  - u = initial velocity (m/s)\n  - t = time (s)\n\n**Equations of Motion** (for uniform acceleration):\n1. v = u + at\n2. s = ut + ½at²\n3. v² = u² + 2as\n4. s = (u+v)t/2\n\nWhere:\n- s = displacement\n- u = initial velocity\n- v = final velocity\n- a = acceleration\n- t = time\n\n**Free Fall:**\n- Objects falling under gravity only\n- Acceleration = g = 10 m/s² (or 9.8 m/s²)\n- Use equations of motion with a = g\n\n**Speed-Time Graphs:**\n- Gradient = acceleration\n- Area under graph = distance traveled\n\n**Distance-Time Graphs:**\n- Gradient = speed\n- Horizontal line = stationary\n- Straight line = constant speed\n- Curved line = changing speed",
