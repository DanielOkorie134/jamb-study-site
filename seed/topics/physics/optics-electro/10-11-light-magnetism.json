    "detailedNotes": "Light is electromagnetic radiation visible to the human eye.\n\nPROPERTIES OF LIGHT:\n- Travels in straight lines\n- Speed in vacuum: c = 3 × 10⁸ m/s\n- Can be reflected, refracted, diffracted\n- Exhibits wave-particle duality\n\nLAWS OF REFLECTION:\n1. Incident ray, reflected ray, and normal lie in same plane\n2. Angle of incidence = Angle of reflection (i = r)\n\nPLANE MIRRORS:\n- Flat reflecting surface\n- Forms virtual, upright, same-size image\n- Image distance = Object distance\n- Laterally inverted (left-right reversed)\n\nCURVED MIRRORS:\n\n1. CONCAVE MIRROR (converging):\n- Curves inward\n- Can form real or virtual images\n- Used in: telescopes, makeup mirrors, headlights\n- Focal point: where parallel rays converge\n\n2. CONVEX MIRROR (diverging):\n- Curves outward\n- Forms virtual, diminished, upright images\n- Used in: vehicle side mirrors, security mirrors\n- Wider field of view\n\nMIRROR TERMS:\n- Principal axis: line through center\n- Pole (P): mirror center\n- Focus (F): focal point\n- Center of curvature (C): sphere center\n- Focal length (f): distance from pole to focus\n- Radius of curvature (r): r = 2f\n\nMIRROR FORMULA:\n1/f = 1/v + 1/u\nwhere:\nf = focal length\nv = image distance\nu = object distance\n\nMAGNIFICATION:\nm = Image height/Object height = v/u\nm > 1: magnified\nm < 1: diminished\nm = 1: same size",

FERROMAGNETIC:\n- Strongly attracted (iron, nickel, cobalt, steel)\n- Can be permanently magnetized\n- Used in permanent magnets\n\n2. PARAMAGNETIC:\n- Weakly attracted (aluminum, platinum)\n- Not permanently magnetized\n\n3. DIAMAGNETIC:\n- Weakly repelled (copper, gold, water)\n- Repelled by magnetic fields\n\nMAKING MAGNETS:\n1. Stroking with another magnet\n2. Electrical method (electromagnet)\n3. Hammering in Earth's field\n\nDEMAGNETIZATION:\n- Heating above Curie temperature\n- Hammering\n- AC current method\n\nELECTROMAGNETS:\n- Temporary magnet from electric current\n- Solenoid + iron core\n- Strength increased by:\n  - More current\n  - More coil turns\n  - Iron core\n\nAPPLICATIONS:\n- Electric motors\n- Generators\n- Loudspeakers\n- MRI machines\n- Magnetic levitation\n\nEARTH'S MAGNETISM:\n- Acts like giant bar magnet\n- Magnetic North ≠ Geographic North\n- Compass aligns with Earth's field",
