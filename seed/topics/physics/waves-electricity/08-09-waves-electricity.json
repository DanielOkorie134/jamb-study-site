    "detailedNotes": "Waves transfer energy without transferring matter.\n\nWAVE TYPES:\n\n1. TRANSVERSE WAVES:\n- Vibrations perpendicular to direction of travel\n- Examples: light, water waves, electromagnetic waves\n- Can be polarized\n\n2. LONGITUDINAL WAVES:\n- Vibrations parallel to direction of travel\n- Examples: sound, seismic P-waves\n- Compressions and rarefactions\n\nWAVE PROPERTIES:\n\n1. Wavelength (λ): Distance between successive crests\n- Unit: meters (m)\n\n2. Frequency (f): Number of waves per second\n- Unit: Hertz (Hz)\n\n3. Period (T): Time for one complete wave\n- T = 1/f\n\n4. Amplitude (A): Maximum displacement from rest\n- Related to energy/intensity\n\n5. Speed (v): Distance traveled per unit time\n\nWAVE EQUATION:\nv = fλ\n(speed = frequency × wavelength)\n\nWAVE PHENOMENA:\n\n1. REFLECTION:\n- Bouncing back from a surface\n- Angle of incidence = Angle of reflection\n\n2. REFRACTION:\n- Bending when entering different medium\n- Speed changes, frequency constant\n- Wavelength changes\n\n3. DIFFRACTION:\n- Spreading around obstacles\n- More diffraction with longer wavelengths\n\n4. INTERFERENCE:\n- Superposition of waves\n- Constructive: crests align (louder/brighter)\n- Destructive: crest meets trough (quieter/darker)\n\n5. POLARIZATION:\n- Transverse waves only\n- Vibrations in one plane\n\nAPPLICATIONS:\n- Communication (radio, TV)\n- Medicine (ultrasound, X-rays)\n- Navigation (radar, sonar)",
