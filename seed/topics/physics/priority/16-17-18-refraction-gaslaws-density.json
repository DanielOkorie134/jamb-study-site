    "detailedNotes": "Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another.\n\nLAWS OF REFRACTION:\n\n1. First Law:\n- Incident ray, refracted ray, and normal lie in same plane\n\n2. Second Law (Snell's Law):\n- n₁sinθ₁ = n₂sinθ₂\n- Or: sin i / sin r = n₂/n₁ = constant\n\nREFRACTIVE INDEX (n):\n- Measure of how much light bends\n- n = speed in vacuum / speed in medium\n- n = c/v\n- Also: n = real depth / apparent depth\n- Higher n = more bending\n\nExamples:\n- Air: n ≈ 1.0\n- Water: n ≈ 1.33\n- Glass: n ≈ 1.5\n- Diamond: n ≈ 2.42\n\nCRITICAL ANGLE (C):\n- Angle of incidence that gives 90° refraction\n- sin C = 1/n (when going from denser to less dense)\n- Beyond critical angle: total internal reflection\n\nTOTAL INTERNAL REFLECTION:\n- Light reflects back into denser medium\n- Conditions: denser to less dense, angle > critical angle\n- Applications: optical fibers, prisms, diamonds sparkle\n\nLENSES:\n\nTypes:\n1. CONVEX (Converging):\n- Thicker at center\n- Converges parallel rays to focus\n- Forms real or virtual images\n- Used in: magnifying glass, cameras, eyes\n\n2. CONCAVE (Diverging):\n- Thinner at center\n- Diverges parallel rays\n- Forms virtual, diminished images\n- Used in: correcting short-sight\n\nLENS TERMS:\n- Principal focus (F): where parallel rays converge/appear to diverge\n- Focal length (f): distance from lens to focus\n- Optical center (O): center of lens\n\nLENS FORMULA:\n1/f = 1/v - 1/u\nwhere:\nf = focal length\nv = image distance\nu = object distance\n\nMAGNIFICATION:\nm = image size / object size = v/u\n\nPOWER OF LENS:\nP = 1/f (f in meters)\nUnit: Diopter (D)\nConvex: positive power\nConcave: negative power\n\nAPPLICATIONS:\n- Microscopes\n- Telescopes\n- Spectacles\n- Cameras\n- Projectors",
