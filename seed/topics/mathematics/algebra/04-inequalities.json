    "detailedNotes": "Inequalities express relationships where values are not equal but greater than, less than, or between certain limits.\n\nINEQUALITY SYMBOLS:\n- > greater than\n- < less than\n- ≥ greater than or equal to\n- ≤ less than or equal to\n\nRULES FOR SOLVING INEQUALITIES:\n1. Addition/Subtraction: Same as equations\n   Example: x + 3 < 7 → x < 4\n\n2. Multiplication/Division by positive number: Direction unchanged\n   Example: 2x < 6 → x < 3\n\n3. Multiplication/Division by negative number: REVERSE the inequality sign\n   Example: -2x < 6 → x > -3\n\n4. Can add/subtract same value to all parts\n\nSOLVING LINEAR INEQUALITIES:\nExample: 3x - 5 < 7\nStep 1: Add 5 to both sides: 3x < 12\nStep 2: Divide by 3: x < 4\nSolution: all values less than 4\n\nCOMPOUND INEQUALITIES:\nTwo types:\n1. AND (conjunction): x > 2 AND x < 5 → 2 < x < 5\n2. OR (disjunction): x < 2 OR x > 5\n\nNUMBER LINE REPRESENTATION:\n- Open circle (○) for < or >\n- Closed circle (●) for ≤ or ≥\n- Arrow shows direction of solutions\n\nGRAPHING ON COORDINATE PLANE:\n- Broken line for < or >\n- Solid line for ≤ or ≥\n- Shade region containing solutions\n- Test point to determine which side to shade\n\nWORD PROBLEMS:\nKey phrases:\n- \"at least\" → ≥\n- \"at most\" → ≤\n- \"more than\" → >\n- \"less than\" → <\n- \"between\" → compound inequality\n\nSYSTEMS OF INEQUALITIES:\n- Graph each inequality\n- Solution is overlapping shaded region\n- Use test points to verify",
