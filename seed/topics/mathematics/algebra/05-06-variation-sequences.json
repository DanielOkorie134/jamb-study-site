    "detailedNotes": "Variation describes how one variable changes in relation to another.\n\nDIRECT VARIATION (y ∝ x):\nAs one increases, the other increases proportionally\n\n- Formula: y = kx\n- k = constant of variation\n- Graph: straight line through origin\n- Example: Distance ∝ Time (at constant speed)\n\nFinding k:\n1. Substitute known values\n2. Solve for k\n3. Write equation with k\n4. Use to find unknowns\n\nINVERSE VARIATION (y ∝ 1/x):\nAs one increases, the other decreases\n\n- Formula: y = k/x or xy = k\n- Graph: hyperbola\n- Example: Speed ∝ 1/Time (for fixed distance)\n\nJOINT VARIATION:\nOne variable varies with product of two or more\n\n- y ∝ xz means y = kxz\n- Example: Volume ∝ length × width × height\n\nPARTIAL VARIATION:\nOne variable is partly constant, partly variable\n\n- Formula: y = kx + c\n- c is the constant part\n- Example: Total cost = Fixed cost + Variable cost per unit\n\nCOMBINED VARIATION:\nCombination of direct and inverse\n\n- Example: y ∝ x/z means y = kx/z\n\nSOLVING PROBLEMS:\n1. Write variation equation\n2. Substitute known values to find k\n3. Write complete equation\n4. Find required values",
