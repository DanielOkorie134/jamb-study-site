    "detailedNotes": "Vectors have both magnitude and direction, while scalars have only magnitude.\n\nSCALARS:\n- Magnitude only\n- Examples: mass, temperature, speed, time, energy, distance\n- Added algebraically\n- 5 kg + 3 kg = 8 kg\n\nVECTORS:\n- Magnitude AND direction\n- Examples: displacement, velocity, force, acceleration, momentum\n- Represented by: arrow, bold letter (v), or letter with arrow (→v)\n- Notation: |v| or v = magnitude\n\nVECTOR REPRESENTATION:\n1. Geometric: arrow\n   - Length = magnitude\n   - Arrow direction = vector direction\n\n2. Component form: v = (x, y)\n   - Column vector: [x; y]\n   - Example: (3, 4)\n\n3. Unit vectors (i, j):\n   - i = (1, 0) - horizontal\n   - j = (0, 1) - vertical\n   - v = xi + yj\n   - Example: 3i + 4j\n\nMAGNITUDE:\n|v| = √(x² + y²)\nExample: |(3, 4)| = √(9 + 16) = 5\n\nVECTOR OPERATIONS:\n\n1. ADDITION:\n- Geometric: tip-to-tail method or parallelogram law\n- Algebraic: add components\n- (a, b) + (c, d) = (a+c, b+d)\n- Example: (3, 2) + (1, 4) = (4, 6)\n\n2. SUBTRACTION:\n- a - b = a + (-b)\n- (a, b) - (c, d) = (a-c, b-d)\n- Example: (5, 7) - (2, 3) = (3, 4)\n\n3. SCALAR MULTIPLICATION:\n- Multiplies magnitude, keeps direction\n- k(a, b) = (ka, kb)\n- Example: 2(3, 4) = (6, 8)\n\nPOSITION VECTORS:\n- From origin to point\n- Point P(x, y) has position vector (x, y)\n\nDIRECTION:\n- Angle θ with positive x-axis\n- tan θ = y/x\n\nEQUAL VECTORS:\n- Same magnitude AND direction\n- Parallel and same length\n\nZERO VECTOR:\n- Magnitude = 0\n- No specific direction\n- (0, 0)\n\nUNIT VECTOR:\n- Magnitude = 1\n- Direction of v: v/|v|\n\nAPPLICATIONS:\n- Navigation\n- Forces in physics\n- Computer graphics\n- Engineering",
