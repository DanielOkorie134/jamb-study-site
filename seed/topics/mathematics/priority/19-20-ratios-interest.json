    "detailedNotes": "Ratios and proportions are used to compare quantities and solve real-world problems.\n\nRATIOS:\nComparison of two or more quantities\n\nNotation:\n- a:b (read \"a to b\")\n- a/b (fraction form)\n\nSimplifying:\n- Divide by HCF\n- 6:9 = 2:3 (÷3)\n- 12:18:24 = 2:3:4 (÷6)\n\nEQUIVALENT RATIOS:\n- Same relationship\n- Multiply/divide by same number\n- 2:3 = 4:6 = 6:9 = 8:12\n\nSHARING IN A RATIO:\nTotal = sum of parts\nEach share = (ratio number / total parts) × total amount\n\nExample: Share 60 in ratio 2:3\n- Total parts = 2+3 = 5\n- First share = 2/5 × 60 = 24\n- Second share = 3/5 × 60 = 36\n\nMAP SCALES:\n- Ratio of map distance to actual distance\n- 1:50,000 means 1 cm = 50,000 cm = 0.5 km\n\nPROPORTION:\nStatement that two ratios are equal\na/b = c/d means a:b = c:d\n\nCross multiplication:\nIf a/b = c/d, then ad = bc\n\nSOLVING PROPORTIONS:\n\nDirect Proportion:\n- As one increases, other increases\n- y ∝ x\n- y/x = constant\n- y₁/x₁ = y₂/x₂\n\nInverse Proportion:\n- As one increases, other decreases\n- y ∝ 1/x\n- xy = constant  \n- x₁y₁ = x₂y₂\n\nUNITARY METHOD:\n1. Find value of one unit\n2. Multiply to get required amount\n\nExample: If 5 pens cost $15, find cost of 8 pens\n- 1 pen = 15/5 = $3\n- 8 pens = 8 × 3 = $24\n\nAPPLICATIONS:\n- Recipes (scaling)\n- Currency conversion\n- Speed-distance-time\n- Business (profit/loss ratios)\n- Mixtures",
