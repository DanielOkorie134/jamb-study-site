    "detailedNotes": "The Periodic Table arranges elements by increasing atomic number, revealing patterns in properties.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Periods: Horizontal rows (7 periods)\n- Groups: Vertical columns (18 groups)\n- Blocks: s, p, d, f (based on electron configuration)\n\nMAJOR GROUPS:\n- Group 1: Alkali metals (very reactive)\n- Group 2: Alkaline earth metals\n- Group 17: Halogens (very reactive non-metals)\n- Group 18: Noble gases (unreactive)\n- Group 3-12: Transition metals\n\nPERIODIC TRENDS:\n\n1. Atomic Radius:\n- Increases down a group (more electron shells)\n- Decreases across a period (stronger nuclear attraction)\n\n2. Ionization Energy:\n- Energy needed to remove an electron\n- Decreases down a group\n- Increases across a period\n\n3. Electronegativity:\n- Ability to attract electrons in a bond\n- Decreases down a group\n- Increases across a period\n- Fluorine is most electronegative\n\n4. Metallic Character:\n- Increases down a group\n- Decreases across a period\n\nELEMENT CLASSIFICATION:\n- Metals: left and center (conduct electricity, malleable)\n- Non-metals: right side (poor conductors, brittle)\n- Metalloids: border between metals and non-metals\n\nVALENY:\n- Group number indicates common valency\n- Group 1: valency 1\n- Group 2: valency 2\n- Group 17: valency 1\n- Group 18: valency 0 (stable)",

        "content": "Compare the atomic radius of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl), both in Period 3.",
        "solution": "Sodium (Na) has a larger atomic radius than chlorine (Cl).\n\nReason: Across a period from left to right, atomic radius decreases due to increased nuclear charge pulling electrons closer. Sodium is on the left of Period 3, chlorine on the right, so sodium has the larger radius."
