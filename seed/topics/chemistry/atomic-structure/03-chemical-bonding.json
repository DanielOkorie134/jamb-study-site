    "detailedNotes": "Chemical bonds form when atoms share or transfer electrons to achieve stable electron configurations.\n\nIONIC BONDING:\n- Transfer of electrons from metal to non-metal\n- Forms positive ions (cations) and negative ions (anions)\n- Held together by electrostatic attraction\n- Example: NaCl (sodium transfers electron to chlorine)\n\nProperties of Ionic Compounds:\n- High melting and boiling points\n- Conduct electricity when molten or dissolved (ions mobile)\n- Hard but brittle crystals\n- Soluble in water (polar solvent)\n\nCOVALENT BONDING:\n- Sharing of electrons between non-metals\n- Forms molecules\n- Electrons shared to fill outer shells\n- Types:\n  • Single bond: 1 pair shared (H-H)\n  • Double bond: 2 pairs shared (O=O)\n  • Triple bond: 3 pairs shared (N≡N)\n\nProperties of Covalent Compounds:\n- Lower melting and boiling points\n- Don't conduct electricity (no free ions)\n- Can be gases, liquids, or soft solids\n- Soluble in non-polar solvents\n\nELECTRONEGATIVITY:\n- Determines bond type\n- Large difference → ionic bond\n- Small difference → covalent bond\n- Equal electronegativity → pure covalent (non-polar)\n\nPOLAR COVALENT BONDS:\n- Unequal sharing of electrons\n- Creates partial charges (δ+ and δ-)\n- Example: H₂O (oxygen more electronegative than hydrogen)\n\nLEWIS DOT STRUCTURES:\n- Diagram showing valence electrons\n- Dots represent electrons\n- Shows bonding and lone pairs\n\nOCTET RULE:\n- Atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve 8 valence electrons\n- Exceptions: hydrogen (wants 2), elements in Period 3+ can exceed octet",

        "solution": "Sodium (Na) has 1 valence electron, chlorine (Cl) has 7 valence electrons.\n\n1. Sodium donates its 1 electron to chlorine\n2. Sodium becomes Na⁺ ion (stable, like neon)\n3. Chlorine becomes Cl⁻ ion (stable, like argon)\n4. Electrostatic attraction holds Na⁺ and Cl⁻ together\n5. Forms ionic compound NaCl"
