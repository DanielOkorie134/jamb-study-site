Heterogeneous: non-uniform (suspensions, colloids)\n\nSEPARATION METHODS:\n\n1. FILTRATION:\n- Separates insoluble solid from liquid\n- Uses filter paper/funnel\n- Residue: solid left on filter\n- Filtrate: liquid that passes through\n- Example: sand from water\n\n2. EVAPORATION:\n- Separates dissolved solid from solution\n- Heat to evaporate liquid\n- Solid remains\n- Example: salt from salt solution\n- Disadvantage: can decompose heat-sensitive substances\n\n3. CRYSTALLIZATION:\n- Purifies soluble solid\n- Heat saturated solution\n- Cool slowly to form crystals\n- More pure than evaporation\n- Example: purifying sugar\n\n4. SIMPLE DISTILLATION:\n- Separates liquid from solution\n- Liquid evaporates, then condenses\n- Collects pure liquid (distillate)\n- Example: pure water from salt solution\n- Requires: different boiling points\n\n5. FRACTIONAL DISTILLATION:\n- Separates miscible liquids\n- Uses fractionating column\n- Separates by boiling point differences\n- Examples:\n  - Crude oil → petroleum fractions\n  - Air → nitrogen, oxygen, argon\n  - Ethanol-water mixture\n\n6. SUBLIMATION:\n- Separates sublimable solid from non-sublimable\n- Solid → gas → solid (no liquid)\n- Examples: iodine, ammonium chloride, naphthalene\n\n7. CHROMATOGRAPHY:\n- Separates dissolved substances\n- Components move at different rates\n- Paper/thin-layer chromatography\n- Uses: separating dyes, inks, amino acids\n\nTerms:\n- Stationary phase: paper/silica\n- Mobile phase: solvent\n- Rf value = distance moved by substance / distance moved by solvent\n\n8. SEPARATING FUNNEL:\n- Separates immiscible liquids\n- Based on density difference\n- Denser liquid settles below\n- Example: oil and water\n\n9. MAGNETIC SEPARATION:\n- Separates magnetic from non-magnetic\n- Example: iron filings from sulfur\n\n10. DECANTATION:\n- Pour off liquid from settled solid\n- Example: water from sand\n\nCHOOSING METHOD:\nDepends on:\n- Physical properties\n- Nature of mixture\n- Required purity\n- Scale of operation",
