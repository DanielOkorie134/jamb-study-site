      "detailedNotes": "**Essential Punctuation Marks:**\n\n**1. Period (.)**\n- Ends declarative sentences\n- Used in abbreviations (Dr., Mr., etc.)\n\n**2. Comma (,)**\n- Separates items in a list: 'I bought rice, beans, and yam.'\n- After introductory phrases: 'After the rain, the sun came out.'\n- Before conjunctions in compound sentences: 'I studied hard, but I still failed.'\n- Around non-essential information: 'My brother, who lives in Lagos, is visiting.'\n\n**3. Semicolon (;)**\n- Joins related independent clauses: 'I love reading; it expands my mind.'\n- Separates complex list items: 'We visited Lagos, Nigeria; Accra, Ghana; and Dakar, Senegal.'\n\n**4. Colon (:)**\n- Introduces a list: 'Bring these items: pen, paper, and calculator.'\n- Introduces an explanation: 'She had one goal: to succeed.'\n\n**5. Apostrophe (')**\n- Shows possession: 'John's book', 'the students' bags'\n- Indicates contractions: 'don't' (do not), 'it's' (it is)\n- Note: 'its' (possessive) vs 'it's' (it is)\n\n**6. Quotation Marks (\" \")**\n- Enclose direct speech: 'She said, \"I am ready.\"'\n- Indicate titles of short works: \"The Road Not Taken\"\n\n**7. Question Mark (?)**\n- Ends questions: 'What is your name?'\n\n**8. Exclamation Mark (!)**\n- Shows strong emotion: 'What a beautiful day!'\n\n**9. Hyphen (-)**\n- Joins compound words: 'twenty-one', 'mother-in-law'\n\n**10. Dash (—)**\n- Indicates a break in thought: 'I was thinking—wait, what was I saying?'\n\n**Common Errors:**\n- ❌ Its' → ✅ Its (possessive has no apostrophe)\n- ❌ The students book → ✅ The student's book\n- ❌ Let's eat grandma → ✅ Let's eat, grandma (commas save lives!)",
