      "explanation": "Verb tenses show when an action occurs (past, present, future), while aspects show how the action relates to time (simple, continuous, perfect, perfect continuous). Mastering tenses is crucial for clear communication and scoring well in JAMB English.",
      "detailedNotes": "**The 12 English Tenses:**\n\n**PRESENT TENSES:**\n1. **Simple Present**: Habitual actions, general truths\n   - Form: base verb (+ s/es for he/she/it)\n   - Example: 'She writes every day.'\n\n2. **Present Continuous**: Actions happening now\n   - Form: am/is/are + verb-ing\n   - Example: 'I am studying now.'\n\n3. **Present Perfect**: Completed actions with present relevance\n   - Form: has/have + past participle\n   - Example: 'They have finished the work.'\n\n4. **Present Perfect Continuous**: Actions that started in the past and continue\n   - Form: has/have been + verb-ing\n   - Example: 'He has been reading for two hours.'\n\n**PAST TENSES:**\n5. **Simple Past**: Completed actions in the past\n   - Form: verb + ed (or irregular form)\n   - Example: 'She visited Lagos yesterday.'\n\n6. **Past Continuous**: Actions in progress in the past\n   - Form: was/were + verb-ing\n   - Example: 'They were playing football.'\n\n7. **Past Perfect**: Actions completed before another past action\n   - Form: had + past participle\n   - Example: 'I had eaten before he arrived.'\n\n8. **Past Perfect Continuous**: Ongoing past actions before another past action\n   - Form: had been + verb-ing\n   - Example: 'She had been waiting for hours.'\n\n**FUTURE TENSES:**\n9. **Simple Future**: Actions that will happen\n   - Form: will + base verb\n   - Example: 'I will travel tomorrow.'\n\n10. **Future Continuous**: Actions in progress in the future\n    - Form: will be + verb-ing\n    - Example: 'We will be celebrating next week.'\n\n11. **Future Perfect**: Actions that will be completed by a future time\n    - Form: will have + past participle\n    - Example: 'By 2025, I will have graduated.'\n\n12. **Future Perfect Continuous**: Ongoing actions up to a future point\n    - Form: will have been + verb-ing\n    - Example: 'By June, I will have been studying for six months.'\n\n**Key Rules:**\n- Use present tense for universal truths: 'The sun rises in the east.'\n- Use past tense for specific past events: 'Nigeria gained independence in 1960.'\n- Don't mix tenses unnecessarily in the same sentence\n- Time expressions help determine tense: yesterday (past), now (present), tomorrow (future)",

          "solution": "**Answer: B) will have finished**\n\n**Explanation:**\n- The action (finishing homework) will be completed before another future action (your arrival)\n- This requires the Future Perfect tense\n- 'By the time' indicates one action will be complete before another\n- Future Perfect form: will have + past participle"

          "solution": "**Answer: 'rings' should be 'rang'**\n\n**Explanation:**\n- The first verb 'was cooking' is in Past Continuous\n- The second verb should also be in the past\n- Correct sentence: 'She was cooking when the phone rang.'\n- Both actions happened in the past, so both verbs must be past tense"
