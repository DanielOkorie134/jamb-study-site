      "explanation": "Subject-verb agreement (concord) means that the subject and verb in a sentence must agree in number. A singular subject takes a singular verb, while a plural subject takes a plural verb. This is one of the most tested grammar rules in JAMB.",
      "detailedNotes": "**Basic Rule:**\nSingular subject + Singular verb\nPlural subject + Plural verb\n\n**Key Rules for JAMB:**\n\n**1. Singular Subjects:**\n- Each, every, either, neither, one, everyone, someone, nobody, anybody → SINGULAR verb\n- Example: 'Each student has a book.' (NOT 'have')\n- Example: 'Everyone is present.' (NOT 'are')\n\n**2. Plural Subjects:**\n- Both, few, many, several → PLURAL verb\n- Example: 'Many students are here.'\n- Example: 'Both boys have arrived.'\n\n**3. Compound Subjects:**\n- Subjects joined by 'and' → PLURAL verb\n  Example: 'John and Mary are friends.'\n- Subjects joined by 'or', 'nor', 'either...or', 'neither...nor' → verb agrees with the NEAREST subject\n  Example: 'Neither the teacher nor the students are ready.'\n  Example: 'Neither the students nor the teacher is ready.'\n\n**4. Collective Nouns:**\n- Treated as singular when acting as a unit\n  Example: 'The team is winning.'\n- Treated as plural when members act individually\n  Example: 'The team are arguing among themselves.'\n\n**5. Uncountable Nouns:**\n- Always singular: information, furniture, equipment, news, advice\n  Example: 'The news is good.'\n  Example: 'The furniture is expensive.'\n\n**6. Special Cases:**\n- 'A number of' → PLURAL verb\n  Example: 'A number of students are absent.'\n- 'The number of' → SINGULAR verb\n  Example: 'The number of students is increasing.'\n\n**7. Expressions of Quantity:**\n- With plural countable nouns → PLURAL verb\n  Example: 'Some of the books are missing.'\n- With uncountable nouns → SINGULAR verb\n  Example: 'Some of the water is contaminated.'\n\n**8. Proximity Concord:**\n- Verb agrees with the nearest subject when using 'or', 'nor', 'either...or', 'neither...nor'\n  Example: 'Either the students or the teacher has the key.'\n\n**Common Errors to Avoid:**\n- ❌ 'The group of students are...' → ✅ 'The group of students is...'\n- ❌ 'Each of the boys have...' → ✅ 'Each of the boys has...'\n- ❌ 'The news are good.' → ✅ 'The news is good.'",

          "solution": "**Answer: B) has**\n\n**Explanation:**\n- 'Everyone' is a singular indefinite pronoun\n- Singular pronouns take singular verbs\n- 'Has' is the singular form\n- Even though 'everyone' refers to multiple people, it's grammatically singular"

          "solution": "**Answer: B) Either the manager or the workers are responsible**\n\n**Explanation:**\n- With 'either...or', the verb agrees with the nearest subject\n- The nearest subject is 'workers' (plural)\n- Therefore, use 'are' (plural verb)\n- If reversed: 'Either the workers or the manager is responsible'"
