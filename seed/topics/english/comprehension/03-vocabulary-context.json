Read the entire sentence containing the word\n2. Look at sentences before and after for context\n3. Identify signal words (however, although, such as)\n4. Replace the word with each option to see which makes sense\n5. Consider the author's tone\n\nTypes of context clues:\n- Definition clues (word is defined in the sentence)\n- Synonym clues (similar word is used)\n- Antonym clues (opposite word provides contrast)\n- Example clues (examples illustrate meaning)\n- Inference clues (meaning implied from general context)\n\nFigurative language to recognize:\n- Metaphors: comparing without 'like' or 'as'\n- Similes: comparing with 'like' or 'as'\n- Personification: giving human qualities to non-human things\n- Hyperbole: extreme exaggeration\n- Idioms: expressions with meanings different from literal words",
