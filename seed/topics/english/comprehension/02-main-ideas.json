      "explanation": "The main idea is the central point or message of a passage, while a topic sentence explicitly states the main idea of a paragraph. Mastering this skill helps you quickly understand what you read and answer comprehension questions accurately.",
      "detailedNotes": "**Understanding Main Ideas:**\n\nThe main idea is what the passage is primarily about. It's the central message the author wants to convey. To find it:\n- Ask yourself: 'What is this passage mostly about?'\n- Look for repeated concepts or themes\n- Identify what most sentences support or explain\n\n**Topic Sentences:**\n\nA topic sentence is usually the first or last sentence of a paragraph and states the paragraph's main point. It:\n- Introduces the subject of the paragraph\n- Sets the tone for what follows\n- Is supported by other sentences in the paragraph\n\n**Key Strategies:**\n\n1. **Skim First**: Read the first and last paragraphs, and the first sentence of each paragraph\n2. **Look for Repetition**: Words or ideas mentioned multiple times are likely central\n3. **Identify Supporting Details**: These explain, prove, or illustrate the main idea\n4. **Eliminate Specifics**: Main ideas are general; specific facts are supporting details\n\n**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**\n- Confusing a supporting detail with the main idea\n- Choosing an idea that's too broad or too narrow\n- Selecting information from only one paragraph in a multi-paragraph passage\n\n**Formula for Success:**\nMain Idea = Topic + What the author says about the topic",
