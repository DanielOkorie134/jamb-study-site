    "detailedNotes": "Sentence structure refers to how words, phrases, and clauses are arranged to create meaning.\n\nTYPES OF SENTENCES:\n\n1. SIMPLE SENTENCE:\n- One independent clause\n- Subject + Verb (+ Object)\n- Example: 'The cat sleeps.'\n- Example: 'John reads books every day.'\n\n2. COMPOUND SENTENCE:\n- Two or more independent clauses\n- Joined by coordinating conjunctions (FANBOYS: For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So)\n- Or joined by semicolon\n- Example: 'I studied hard, and I passed the exam.'\n- Example: 'She loves music; he prefers silence.'\n\n3. COMPLEX SENTENCE:\n- One independent clause + one or more dependent clauses\n- Uses subordinating conjunctions (because, although, when, if, since, while, etc.)\n- Example: 'Although it rained, we went outside.'\n- Example: 'I will help you if you ask nicely.'\n\n4. COMPOUND-COMPLEX SENTENCE:\n- Two or more independent clauses + one or more dependent clauses\n- Example: 'I studied hard because the exam was important, and I passed with high marks.'\n\nCLAUSE TYPES:\n- Independent clause: can stand alone as a sentence\n- Dependent clause: cannot stand alone, needs independent clause\n\nPUNCTUATION RULES:\n- Comma before FANBOYS in compound sentences\n- Comma after dependent clause when it starts the sentence\n- Semicolon can join independent clauses without conjunction",
