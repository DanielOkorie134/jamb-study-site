    "detailedNotes": "The mole is the SI unit for amount of substance.\n\nTHE MOLE:\n- 1 mole = 6.02 × 10²³ particles (Avogadro's number)\n- Particles can be atoms, molecules, ions, etc.\n\nMOLAR MASS:\n- Mass of 1 mole of substance\n- Numerically equal to relative formula mass\n- Unit: g/mol\n- Example: H₂O = 18 g/mol\n\nFORMULAS:\n\n1. Number of moles:\nn = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol)\nn = volume (dm³) / 24 (for gases at STP)\nn = volume (cm³) / 24000\nn = concentration × volume (dm³)\n\n2. Mass:\nmass = moles × molar mass\n\n3. Number of particles:\nParticles = moles × 6.02 × 10²³\n\nSTOICHIOMETRY:\nQuantitative relationships in chemical reactions\n\nSTEPS:\n1. Write balanced equation\n2. Identify known and unknown\n3. Convert to moles\n4. Use mole ratio from equation\n5. Convert to required units\n\nLIMITING REAGENT:\n- Reactant that runs out first\n- Determines amount of product\n- Other reactants in excess\n\nPERCENTAGE YIELD:\n% yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) × 100%\n\nCONCENTRATION:\n- Moles per dm³ (mol/dm³)\n- Conc = moles / volume\n\nEMPIRICAL FORMULA:\n- Simplest ratio of atoms\n- From percentage composition\n\nMOLECULAR FORMULA:\n- Actual number of atoms\n- Multiple of empirical formula",
