PITCH:\n- Determined by frequency\n- High pitch = high frequency\n- Low pitch = low frequency\n- Human range: 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz\n\n2. LOUDNESS:\n- Determined by amplitude\n- Large amplitude = loud sound\n- Small amplitude = soft sound\n- Measured in decibels (dB)\n\n3. QUALITY (Timbre):\n- Distinguishes sources\n- Same note, different instruments\n\nECHO:\n- Reflection of sound\n- Minimum distance for echo: ~17 m\n- Used in: sonar, echolocation\n\nRESONANCE:\n- Maximum vibration at natural frequency\n- Applications: musical instruments\n- Dangers: building collapse\n\nAPPLICATIONS:\n- Ultrasound: > 20,000 Hz (medical imaging)\n- Infrasound: < 20 Hz (earthquake detection)\n- Sonar: underwater detection\n- Musical instruments\n\nFORMULAS:\n- v = fλ (wave equation)\n- Distance = speed × time (echo)",
